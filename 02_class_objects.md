### **2. Classes and Objects in Python**


---

#### **What is a Class?**

- A **class** is a blueprint for creating objects. 
- It defines a set of attributes (data) and methods (functions) that characterize any object of the class. 
- In Python, classes are created using the `class` keyword.

##### **Syntax:**
```python
class ClassName:
    # Class attributes and methods
```

##### **Example:**
```python
class Dog:
    # Class attributes
    species = "Canis familiaris"  # Shared by all instances

    # Constructor
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name  # Instance attribute
        self.age = age    # Instance attribute

    # Method
    def bark(self):
        return f"{self.name} says woof!"
```

#### **What is an Object?**

- An **object** is an instance of a class. 
- When a class is defined, no memory is allocated until an object of that class is created. 
- Each object can have different attribute values, even though they share the same class structure.

##### **Creating an Object:**
To create an object, you simply call the class as if it were a function.

##### **Example:**
```python
my_dog = Dog("Buddy", 3)  # Create an object of Dog class
print(my_dog.bark())      # Output: Buddy says woof!
```

---

### **Class Attributes vs Instance Attributes**

- **Class Attributes**:
  - Shared across all instances of the class.
  - Defined within the class but outside any methods.
  
  Example:
  ```python
  class Dog:
      species = "Canis familiaris"  # Class attribute
  ```

- **Instance Attributes**:
  - Specific to each instance of the class.
  - Defined in the `__init__` method (the constructor) using `self`.

  Example:
  ```python
  class Dog:
      def __init__(self, name, age):
          self.name = name  # Instance attribute
          self.age = age    # Instance attribute
  ```

### **The `self` Keyword**

- `self` refers to the instance of the class and allows access to the attributes and methods of the class in Python.
- It must be the first parameter of any function in the class, although it is not explicitly passed when you call the method on an object.

##### **Example:**
```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name  # Instance attribute

    def bark(self):
        return f"{self.name} says woof!"

my_dog = Dog("Buddy")
print(my_dog.bark())  # Output: Buddy says woof!
```

Sure! Let’s break down the `self` keyword in a clearer and more detailed way.

### What is `self`?

- **`self` is a reference to the current instance of the class.**
- It allows you to access attributes and methods of that specific instance.
- Think of it as a way for the object to refer to itself.

### Why Use `self`?

1. **Distinguish between Instance and Local Variables**: 
   - When you create variables inside a method, they are local to that method. By using `self`, you can define instance variables that belong to the object itself.

2. **Access Instance Attributes**: 
   - `self` lets you access and modify attributes of the instance from other methods within the class.

3. **Pass the Instance**: 
   - When you call a method on an object, Python passes the instance to the method automatically as the first argument. This is why you need to include `self` in the method definition.

### Example Walkthrough

Let’s take a closer look at the `Dog` class example:

```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name  # Here, self.name is an instance attribute
        self.age = age    # Here, self.age is also an instance attribute

    def bark(self):
        return f"{self.name} says Woof!"  # Accessing the instance attribute self.name

    def get_age(self):
        return f"{self.name} is {self.age} years old."  # Accessing self.name and self.age

# Creating an instance of the Dog class
my_dog = Dog("Buddy", 3)

# Accessing methods
print(my_dog.bark())         # Output: Buddy says Woof!
print(my_dog.get_age())      # Output: Buddy is 3 years old.
```

### Breakdown of Each Part

1. **Class Definition**: 
   - The `Dog` class is defined with an `__init__` method and two other methods (`bark` and `get_age`).

2. **`__init__` Method**: 
   - This is the initializer (constructor) method. It is called when you create a new instance of the class.
   - `self.name` and `self.age` are instance attributes, which means they are unique to each `Dog` object you create. 
   - For example, if you create another dog `my_second_dog = Dog("Max", 5)`, `my_second_dog` will have its own `name` and `age`.

3. **Methods**: 
   - The `bark` method uses `self.name` to access the name of the specific dog instance that called it.
   - The `get_age` method uses both `self.name` and `self.age` to return a message about the dog's age.

4. **Creating an Instance**: 
   - When you create `my_dog = Dog("Buddy", 3)`, the `__init__` method is called, setting `my_dog.name` to "Buddy" and `my_dog.age` to `3`.

5. **Calling Methods**: 
   - When you call `my_dog.bark()`, Python automatically passes `my_dog` as the `self` parameter to the `bark` method, allowing it to use the `name` of that specific dog instance.
   - Similarly, when you call `my_dog.get_age()`, it accesses `self.name` and `self.age` for the `my_dog` instance.

### Summary

- **`self` is essential** for defining instance variables and accessing them in methods.
- It differentiates between local variables (defined within a method) and instance variables (attached to the object).
- Without `self`, you wouldn't be able to refer to the instance's attributes or methods from within the class.

---

### **Creating Methods in a Class**

- Methods are functions defined within a class that can operate on instance attributes. 
- They define the behavior of the objects created from the class.

##### **Example:**
```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def bark(self):
        return f"{self.name} says woof!"

    def get_age(self):
        return f"{self.name} is {self.age} years old."

my_dog = Dog("Buddy", 3)
print(my_dog.bark())      # Output: Buddy says woof!
print(my_dog.get_age())   # Output: Buddy is 3 years old.
```

### **Summary of Classes and Objects**

- A **class** is a blueprint for creating objects, containing attributes and methods.
- An **object** is an instance of a class, created using the class name.
- **Class attributes** are shared across all instances, while **instance attributes** are unique to each object.
- The `self` keyword allows access to instance attributes and methods within a class.
- Methods define the behavior of the class and can operate on instance attributes.
